# JToH Bot

**Do you need a solution for JToH/JToH fangame Discord servers? Here's the answer!**

**JToH Bot** is a Discord bot designed for JToH-based Discord servers and already has defaults for **JToH**, **AToS**, **CSCD**, and **JToH XL**.

## Feature List

* **Multi-Game Support -** Supports JToH and popular fangames. Admins can add custom fangames too!
* **Profiles -** Links Roblox and Discord, and gives Discord members tower profiles for selected games.
* **Non-Canon Towers -** Admins can add non-canon/badge unverifiable towers to users' profiles.
* **Role Management -** Assigns roles for completing towers of certain difficulties or a certain tower.
* **New Hardest Announcements -** New hardests, among other things can be logged automatically.
* **Web UI -** This all can be configured from a web interface launched with the bot!

## User Profiles

User profiles are server-wide profiles for tower statistics. Each user's entire completion history will be accessible by server members.

These statistics span across every selected game and combine completions from each.

Server admins can add badge-unverifiable towers to a user profile, and edit various other statistics that cannot be automatically retrieved, such as best time, or total time before completion. These statistics can be used to create leaderboards for the best server-wide completion of a certain tower.

## Full Customization

Server owners can edit difficulty values they don't agree with, disable towers from being automatically verified in profiles, or completely disable certain towers.

Server owners can also add new badges to existing games, like past event tower badges. It is also possible to add completely custom games!

Non-canon towers can be added to a game for server admins to add to profiles. Difficulties range from Bottom Easy to Peak Nil!

## Setup/Contributing

Contributors should refer to `CONTRIBUTING.MD` before cloning/forking.

**JToH Bot** is currently self-hosting, which is more secure for server administrators and completely free. The performance of the bot depends on the hardware it is being executed on, and the bot will only function while being executed.

*Instructions is a WIP, the bot may be moved to a separate repository*
